# The Ship Builder's Manifest

## Philosophy

We build software the way ships are built: for critical systems where failure is not an option.

When a ship goes to sea, there is no tech support. No patches. No "have you tried rebooting?" The systems must work, absolutely and completely, or people die.

This is the mindset we bring to software.

## Principles

### 1. Radical Simplicity

Complexity is the enemy. Every line of code is a liability. Every abstraction layer is a potential failure point.

We choose simple over clever. We choose understandable over impressive. We choose 100 lines that work over 10,000 lines that might.

### 2. Outcome-Based Engineering

We measure success by outcomes, not activity. Code that doesn't run is worthless. Features that don't ship are fantasies.

Every commit should either:
- Make something work that didn't
- Make something work better that did
- Remove something that wasn't needed

### 3. Long-Term Sustainability

We build for decades, not sprints. The code we write today should be readable, maintainable, and functional in 2050.

This means:
- No dependencies that might disappear
- No clever tricks that require tribal knowledge
- No shortcuts that trade future pain for present convenience

### 4. Complete Understanding

We don't use what we don't understand. If we can't explain every byte, every instruction, every decision—we don't ship it.

This limits what we can build, but guarantees what we do build.

### 5. Trust Through Transparency

The entire system is visible. The entire system is auditable. There are no black boxes, no "just trust us" components.

Anyone can read the source. Anyone can verify the behavior. Anyone can understand the whole.

## Why Forth?

Forth embodies these principles:

- **Simple**: The entire language fits in your head
- **Transparent**: You can see every word's definition
- **Efficient**: No hidden costs, no surprise allocations
- **Extensible**: The language grows to fit the problem
- **Proven**: 50+ years of use in critical systems

When the Philae lander touched down on a comet 500 million kilometers from Earth, Forth was there. When the Green Bank Telescope scans the cosmos, Forth is there.

Forth doesn't make you feel clever. It makes you feel capable.

## Who We're Looking For

This project isn't for everyone. We're looking for people who:

- **Think in decades**: Not interested in what's trendy, interested in what lasts
- **Value reliability over features**: Would rather have 10 things that work than 100 things that might
- **Understand systems deeply**: Can reason about hardware, software, and everything in between
- **Work with discipline**: Document their work, test their code, communicate clearly

Ideal backgrounds include:
- Space sciences and orbital mechanics
- Control systems and avionics
- Marine engineering and ship building
- Embedded systems and bare-metal programming

If you've ever been responsible for a system where failure meant more than an error message—we should talk.

## The Commitment

We're not looking for contributors. We're looking for crew.

The difference:
- Contributors submit PRs and move on
- Crew take responsibility for the voyage

We're seeking 2-3 people who will:
- Invest years, not hours
- Share the philosophy, not just the work
- Build relationships, not just code

## Contact

If this resonates, reach out. Tell us:
- What you've built that you're proud of
- What you've learned from failure
- Why this matters to you

We don't need resumes. We need stories.
