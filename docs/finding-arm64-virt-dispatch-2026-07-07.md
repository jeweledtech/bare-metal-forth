# Finding: ARM64 virt dispatch fault — 2026-07-07

## Context

Phase C.1 of the metacompiler: switching the ARM64
boot test from raspi3b (broken TCP serial) to QEMU
virt machine (reliable PL011). target-arm64.fth was
parameterized with board-config variables (A64- prefix),
VIRT-CONFIG/RASPI3B-CONFIG, and BUILD-ARM64-VIRT/
BUILD-ARM64-RASPI entry words.

## Observation table (original, 2026-07-07)

| Register | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| PC | 0x0000000000000200 | EL1 sync vector (no handler) |
| ELR | 0x401A1FA4 | Faulting instruction (~648KB past 8KB image) |
| ESR | 0x2000000 | EC=0 Undefined Instruction, IL=1 (32-bit) |
| X25 (PSP) | 0x4013FFFC | Data stack init'd, one push each — |
| X26 (RSP) | 0x4014FFFC | consistent with fault inside single DOCOL nesting |
| X27 (IP) | 0x40101CB4 | Forth IP, offset 0x1CB4 in image |

## Resolution — three bugs (2026-07-09)

### Bug #33a: Backward branch address-space mix (FIXED)

**Root cause:** `A64-BCOND-BACK,` in arm64-asm.fth
subtracts `T-HERE @` (host address) from `dest`. Three
callers in target-arm64.fth (KEY line 920, EMIT line
935, CMOVE line 1101) passed `T-ADDR` (target address).
The subtraction crossed address spaces, producing a
~660KB forward branch instead of a small backward
branch. EMIT's `B.NE` jumped to `0x401A1FA4` — zeroed
RAM decoded as UDF — confirming the ELR nibble was
`0x401A1FA4`, not `0x40101FA4`.

The dichotomy from the original finding resolves as
**computed wild address** (address-space mixing in the
branch offset calculation), not a device-region read.

**Fix:** Changed three caller sites from `T-ADDR` to
`T-HERE @`. The assembler's host-addr contract was
correct all along — the original comment ("dest is
host addr in T-IMAGE") documented the truth.

**First fix attempt (wrong direction):** Changed
`A64-BCOND-BACK,` itself to use `T-ADDR`. This broke
at load time: ARM64-ASM compiles before META-COMPILER
is on the search chain, so `T-ADDR` is not visible
during ARM64-ASM's block loading (`T-ADDR ?` errors).
The contract mismatch was on the caller side.

**Verification:** Static byte-decode of all three
`B.cond` instructions in the rebuilt image confirmed
small negative imm19 values (KEY: -2, EMIT: -2,
CMOVE: -5 instructions back). `in_asm` trace on the
fixed image: zero exceptions, kernel sits in KEY
poll loop waiting for input. Private repo fa36980.

**Latent hazard:** thumb2-asm.fth `T2W-B-BACK,` has
the same contract (host-addr dest) but zero callers.
Warning comment added referencing bug #33 so the
future Cortex-M caller doesn't repeat this trap.

### Bug #33b: INTERPRET stack bug (FIXED)

**Root cause:** ARM64's `MC-INTERPRET-ARM64` had
`>R -ROT 2DROP R> SWAP` to clean up after FIND's
3-value return `(xt flg TRUE)`. The `-ROT 2DROP`
discarded `xt` instead of `(addr len)`, causing
`EXECUTE` to receive `TRUE` (-1) instead of the
word's CFA.

**Why x86 was green:** `target-x86.fth` line 1507
uses `T-ALIAS` to re-expose the kernel's native
assembly INTERPRET. The ARM64 target is the *first
consumer* of the Forth-coded INTERPRET. x86 B6b's
17/17 green never covered this code path.

**Fix:** Replaced with `DROP >R >R 2DROP R> R>`.
DROP discards TRUE; >R saves flg then xt (LIFO: xt
on top of R-stack); 2DROP removes addr,len; R>
restores xt then flg. No SWAP needed — LIFO pop
order is natural.

**Verification:** Decoded INTERPRET's compiled cell
stream from the image. Traced both the success path
`(addr len xt flg TRUE)` → `DROP >R >R 2DROP R> R>`
→ `(xt flg)` → `STATE @ 0BRANCH` → `DROP EXECUTE`
and the miss path (untouched: 0BRANCH skips the
entire new sequence). FIND flag convention confirmed:
-1 = IMMEDIATE, +1 = normal. Compile-mode branch
`-1 = IF EXECUTE ELSE , THEN` is correct sense.
Private repo fa36980.

### Bug #33c: DOT/NUMBER output (OPEN)

**Symptom:** DOT produces wrong output for every
value. Multi-digit NUMBER also broken.

**Constraint table (10 data points, deterministic):**

| Input n | Output | Sign | Digit 1 | Digit 2 |
|---------|--------|------|---------|---------|
| 0 | -81 | - | 8 | 1 |
| 1 | -71 | - | 7 | 1 |
| 2 | -61 | - | 6 | 1 |
| 3 | -51 | - | 5 | 1 |
| 4 | -41 | - | 4 | 1 |
| 5 | -31 | - | 3 | 1 |
| 6 | -21 | - | 2 | 1 |
| 7 | -11 | - | 1 | 1 |
| 8 | -01 | - | 0 | 1 |
| 9 | -91 | - | 9 | 1 |

Multi-digit NUMBER: `12 .` → `12 ?` (parse failure).
`48` also fails to parse (multi-digit).

**Constraints any correct theory must satisfy:**

1. Sign always negative (for non-negative inputs 0-9)
2. First digit = `(8-n) mod 10` as ASCII
3. Second digit always `1`
4. Exactly two digits regardless of input magnitude
5. Multi-digit input takes the `?` error path
6. Single-digit NUMBER "succeeds" (DOT runs, not `?`)
7. +1 input → +10 output (factor-of-10 relationship)

**What is NOT verified:** Single-digit NUMBER may
push garbage — DOT being broken means no verified
observation of NUMBER's actual output.

**Eliminated hypotheses:**

- **MUL Ra-field (MADD accumulate register):** All
  four MUL instructions in image have Ra=31 (WZR).
  Clean. Bit-checked, not eyeballed from disassembly.
- **Comparison word encoding:** All CSINC+SUB patterns
  correct for standard Forth TRUE(-1)/FALSE(0).
- **DOCON/sysvar addresses:** All six match expected
  SYSVARS+offset values.
- **ROT-depth in NUMBER accumulate:** If ROT couldn't
  reach the accumulator and multiplied `addr` instead,
  the result would be near `0x40120000 * 10` — a
  ten-digit number. Observed output is exactly three
  characters. **Fails retrodiction.** May contain a
  real ingredient (the compiled NUMBER body needs full
  hand-simulation against cells, not source), but does
  not explain the data as stated.

**Queued decisive experiments:**

1. **EMIT-bypass discriminator:**
   `8 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + EMIT` (expect '0'). Uses
   only `+` and EMIT, no DOT, no multi-digit NUMBER.
   If it prints '0': arithmetic and single-digit
   NUMBER are clean, fault isolates to DOT's rendering
   path (plus multi-digit NUMBER as possibly separate
   issue). If it prints something else: decode which
   byte arrived; the delta from 48 names the corrupted
   quantity. Either branch, the next session opens
   with information instead of theory.
2. **Full hand-simulation of NUMBER's compiled cells:**
   Walk the actual cell stream in the image for input
   "0", tracing every stack operation against the real
   compiled body — not the source. The source-reading
   method has been wrong three times this week.

## Verification lessons (three-cornered)

Three independent instances of "green that didn't
cover what it appeared to" emerged from this arc:

1. **Banner-green ≠ interactive-green.** raspi3b's
   "boot verified" meant the kernel printed "ok" but
   never executed interactive Forth deep enough to hit
   the dispatch fault. The virt switch exposed this.

2. **Substring-green ≠ correct-green.** The test
   assertion `'7' in response` matched `-37`. The
   Phase 4 "3 4 + . = 7 PASS" was a false positive
   manufactured by the check, not the kernel.
   test_arm64_boot.py needs anchored/delimited
   matching before committing.

3. **Executed-green ≠ covered-green.** x86 B6b's
   17/17 interactive tests all passed, but the
   Forth-coded INTERPRET was never exercised: x86
   used `T-ALIAS` to the kernel's native assembly
   INTERPRET. The green was real but covered a
   different code path than it appeared to.

These three lessons apply directly to C.3 (Cortex-M)
first contact — each claim of "X works" must specify
which code path was actually executed.

## Verification of #33a/#33b — 2026-07-10

**Provenance:** All three ARM64 source files
(`target-arm64.fth`, `arm64-asm.fth`,
`thumb2-asm.fth`) are PRIVATE-OWNED and gitignored
in the public repo (`.gitignore:82-84`). Bug #33a
was introduced in the private copy; fix landed at
private repo fa36980; the public working-tree copies
carry the fix via sync.

**Static verification:** Fresh build via
BUILD-ARM64-VIRT (8032 bytes, 147 symbols, zero
unresolved). All three B.NE backward branches
decoded from the binary:

| Offset | Instruction | imm19 | Word |
|--------|-------------|-------|------|
| +0x0DAC | 0x54FFFFC1 | -2 | KEY |
| +0x0DF0 | 0x54FFFFC1 | -2 | EMIT |
| +0x1120 | 0x54FFFF61 | -5 | CMOVE |

All small negative offsets. No 648KB wild jumps.

**Dynamic verification:** ARM64 virt boots to `ok`
prompt over PL011 TCP serial. INTERPRET runs (colon
defs accepted). EMIT/KEY poll loops work (interactive
I/O functional). #33a and #33b are closed.

**Grep audit:** Zero instances of T-ADDR flowing
into any backward-branch emitter. `thumb2-asm.fth`
`T2W-B-BACK,` has zero callers and carries the
bug #33 warning comment.

**Test assertions fixed:** `test_arm64_boot.py`
Phase 4 checks now use `has_word()` with `\b`
anchors instead of bare `in` — eliminates the
`'7' in '-37'` false-positive pattern.

## EMIT-bypass experiment results — 2026-07-10

### Round 1: arithmetic via EMIT

**Single-digit NUMBER:** Correct. `0` through `9`
each push the expected integer (verified via EMIT:
`0 EMIT` → 0x00, `9 EMIT` → 0x09).

**Multi-digit NUMBER:** Completely broken. All
two-digit literals (`10`, `48`, `65`) fail to parse
(`?` error). This is separate from the stack bug.

**Arithmetic via EMIT (bypasses DOT entirely):**

| Expression | Expected | Got | Hex |
|-----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1 1 + | 2 | 2 | 0x02 |
| 2 3 + | 5 | 4 | 0x04 |
| 5 3 - | 2 | -2 | 0xFE |
| 3 2 * | 6 | 2 | 0x02 |
| 8 DUP + | 16 | 16 | 0x10 |
| 8 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + | 48 | 9 | 0x09 |

**Discriminating pair:** `2 3 +`=4 (fails) vs
`8 DUP +`=16 (works). Both execute `+` on two
cells. The only difference: in the failing case
both operands were pushed by INTERPRET's number
path; in the working case the second came from
DUP. If `+` were broken, `DUP +` would fail too.

### Round 2: TOS-overwrite discriminator

Hypothesis: INTERPRET's number-push path stores
at TOS without advancing SP. Consecutive literals
overwrite each other; primitives then read a stale
cell below SP.

| Test | Got | Healthy | Overwrite (stale=1) |
|------|-----|---------|---------------------|
| `2 3 DROP EMIT` | **0x01** | 0x02 | 0x01 ✓ |
| `7 DROP EMIT` | **0x01** | — | 0x01 ✓ |
| `5 DROP EMIT` | **0x01** | — | 0x01 ✓ |
| `9 DROP EMIT` | **0x01** | — | 0x01 ✓ |
| `2 3 SWAP DROP EMIT` | **0x03** | 0x03 | 0x03 ✓ |
| `2 3 OVER EMIT` | **0x01** | 0x02 | 0x01 ✓ |

Every row matches the overwrite theory. The stale
cell is consistently 1 across all tests.

**Confirmed: interpret-mode number pushes net zero
cells** — consecutive literals overwrite one slot
while primitive-pushed cells (DUP, OVER) occupy
their own. Leading mechanism: missing SP-advance
in MC-INTERPRET-ARM64's NUMBER-success path (#33b's
sibling branch); source inspection will confirm.

### Retrodiction of all earlier data

All six Round 1 results now have a single explanation:

- `2 3 +`=4: only one cell (3) pushed; `+` reads
  3 and stale(1) → 3+1=4 ✓
- `5 3 -`=0xFE: only one cell (3); `-` reads 3
  and stale(1) → 1-3=-2 ✓ (order preserved,
  NOS=stale is first operand)
- `3 2 *`=2: only one cell (2); `*` reads 2
  and stale(1) → 1*2=2 ✓
- `1 1 +`=2: stale(1) coincidentally equals the
  intended first operand ✓
- `8 DUP +`=16: DUP copies TOS without going
  through INTERPRET's number path — SP advances
  correctly, giving two real cells ✓
- Chain `8 8 + ...`=9: first `+` gets 8+stale(1)=9;
  then `8` overwrites 9 with 8; next `+` gets
  8+stale(1)=9 again; repeats ✓

The DOT constraint table is a consequence: DOT's
digit-extraction code is probably correct, but it
receives wrong input because the number it's
printing was computed via broken stack state.

### Next step

Inspect MC-INTERPRET-ARM64's number-success path
in target-arm64.fth — the sequence between NUMBER
returning and INTERPRET looping. The fix is likely
a missing SP-advance (EMIT-PUSH or equivalent)
before or after the store. Compare with the
FIND-success path that was fixed for #33b.

## WIP: deeper investigation — 2026-07-10

### Finding: INTERPRET stack leak identified

Source inspection of MC-INTERPRET-ARM64's NUMBER
path found the exact leak site. After FIND fails
(line 1851), it returns `(addr len FALSE)`,
preserving its input. The `2DUP` at line 1850 made
a copy for FIND; FIND preserved it on failure. After
`DROP` at line 1881 (removes FALSE), two copies of
`(addr len)` remain. The subsequent `2DUP` + NUMBER
+ `-ROT 2DROP` cleans only one copy — the other
leaks.

**Candidate fix:** Add `S" 2DROP" T-COMPILE-NAME`
between lines 1881 and 1882. Verified by stack trace
through both success and failure NUMBER paths.

**Retrodiction confirmed:** stale cell = 1 IS the
`len` field from the leaked `(WORD-BUF len)` pair —
all test inputs are single-digit words (len=1).

### Finding #33d: colon defs don't execute

`: T7 7 EMIT ; T7` → empty output. Interactive
colon definitions compile (no `?` error) but produce
no output when called. First-class Phase 4 gate
failure — separate from comparisons and stack leak.

### Finding: ALL comparison words inverted

Runtime probing (not source analysis) established:

| Test | Expected | Got |
|------|----------|-----|
| `5 0= EMIT` | FALSE(0) | 0x00 ✓ |
| `0 0= EMIT` | TRUE(-1) | **0x00** ✗ |
| `5 0< EMIT` | FALSE(0) | **0xFF** ✗ |
| `0 0< EMIT` | FALSE(0) | **0xFF** ✗ |
| `5 0> EMIT` | TRUE(-1) | **0x00** ✗ |
| `0 0> EMIT` | FALSE(0) | 0x00 ✓ |
| `5 NEGATE 0< EMIT` | TRUE(-1) | **0x00** ✗ |
| `5 NEG NEG 0< EMIT` | FALSE(0) | **0xFF** ✗ |

Every non-trivial comparison returns the opposite
of expected. DOT's `-31` for input 5 is explained:
DOT's `0<` returns TRUE for positive input, causing
NEGATE(5)=-5, then (DOTR) on the unsigned magnitude
produces `31`.

### CRITICAL: provenance gap discovered

Two contradictions expose a stale-artifact problem:

**C1 — ?DUP: source buggy, runtime correct.**
Source at line 355 reads `W0 W0 A64-CMP,` (compares
W0 with itself — always EQUAL, ?DUP should never
push). But runtime: `5 ?DUP EMIT` → 0x05 (correct),
`0 ?DUP EMIT` → 0x00 (correct). If the source being
read built the binary being run, ?DUP would be
broken. It isn't.

**C2 — 0<: binary correct, runtime wrong.**
Binary at +0x08D8 decodes field-by-field to correct
CSINC W0, WZR, WZR, GE (= CSET W0, LT). QEMU
monitor confirms memory matches. But runtime 0<
returns inverted results for all inputs.

**One hypothesis explains both:** the running binary
was NOT built from the source tree being read.
`/tmp/forthos-arm64.bin` is a loose file with no
provenance chain — no hash, no build timestamp,
no verification that this session's `pmemsave`
produced the file being analyzed.

### Lesson: observation beat reasoning

Every hour went into static analysis of source and
binary. The two facts that broke the case (?DUP
works despite buggy source; comparisons inverted
despite correct encoding) both came from cheap
runtime probes. The ?DUP contradiction sat in the
transcript for the entire session; it was noticed,
rationalized ("maybe I misread"), and moved past.
Static analysis cannot resolve provenance questions.

## Phase C.1 gate status: PARTIALLY MET

INTERPRET, EMIT, KEY work. #33a and #33b closed.
#33c characterized (stack leak + comparison
inversion) but blocked on provenance verification.
#33d (colon def execution) is a new gate failure.

## DTB collision (fixed earlier, 2026-07-07)

QEMU virt places DTB at 0x40000000-0x40100000.
Initial A64-ORG=0x40000000 caused ROM overlap error.
Fixed: A64-ORG=0x40100000 clears the DTB. Committed
to private repo as fbd17fa.

## Queued follow-ups (sequencing matters)

1. **Provenance reset** — clean rebuild, sha256
   source tree + image, boot by hash, re-run the
   six-probe comparison table. No analysis until
   source↔binary lineage is proven.
2. If mystery persists: **marker-patch** on 0< body
   (MOV W0,#0x2A / PUSH / NEXT). 0x2A output →
   that code IS what runs (check analysis scripts
   for host/target address mixing). 0xFF still →
   execution never reaches that code (hunt second
   emitter or T-ALIAS path).
3. **Full-body runtime dump** of 0< (all 5 insns
   after boot) compared word-for-word against image.
4. Fix stack leak (add 2DROP) — but NOT until
   provenance is clean.
5. Do NOT fix ?DUP until step 1 explains why
   runtime ?DUP currently works despite buggy source.
6. Fix multi-digit NUMBER (separate bug)
7. Investigate #33d (colon def execution failure)
8. VBAR_EL1 crash-reporting stub
9. Embed boundary assertion (oldest debt)
~~10. Fix test_arm64_boot.py assertions~~ Done
   2026-07-10: anchored regex matching
